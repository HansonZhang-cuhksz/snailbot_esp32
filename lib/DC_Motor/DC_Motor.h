/* DC motor library for Arduino
created by Ashutosh M Bhatt (+91-9998476150) - Gujarat (INDIA) 
ver 1.0 - 12/10/2016

this library is used to control DC motors
it can control its speed from 0 to 100% and its direction
it can rotate motor forward and reverse at set speed 
it can start or stop the motor as well as provides DC BREAK for instant STOP 
just one has to select arduino pins for motor,then then start rotating motor using given library functions
